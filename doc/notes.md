# Todo tasks
  [/] fix blinking coffee pan
      -> now only updates coffee pan when it's level changes
      -> still blinks when updating..
  [ ] Implement time manager for timed tasks etc.
    [ ] Implement offline (game closed) income, maxing out at maybe 72h?
    [ ] 1min = 1 hour game time, students drink 1 cup of coffee / hour
  [ ] Refactor game.js into different files for clarity
      // ie. Save/Load game logic should be it's own thing.

  [ ] Host somewhere
  [ ] Get domain
  [ ] Add Google analytics to stalk visitors
  [ ] Back-end for storing user saves (not just localhost)
